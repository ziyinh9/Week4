    "#### Extracting the data\n",
    "Scanning closely (or matching the rendered web sites content text), we can see that the actual lyrics are inside of a div with the `'songLyricsDiv-outer'` id. That's easy to collect, since we just want the text from this div (and there's only one). Getting the meta-data, e.g., album, is a bit more complicated. The meta-data comes just under the the `'h1'` title as a link, between `'p'` tags. Notice additionally that meta-data attributes come in the text format `'key: value'`. So, filtering `'p'` tag text for colon-space, \": \", we get what we want. However these entries are much more useful if we actually parse them into keys and values, e.g., transform `\"Genre: Rock\"` into a python dictionary `{\"Genre\": \"Rock\"}`. This is done with the `re.split()` command, delimiting by any first `\": \"`. Any meta-data attributes and the lyrics themselves are then stored in the artists data dictionary, and we're done with the song! Phew!"
